                    Hi there! I’m Byron.Thanks for visiting my website - I hope you don’t find it too bland and I hope I can take a look at your's as well.. I'm a student in the Columbia Coding Bootcamp and am really enjoying the course and learning lots of new things it's really cool.
                    I’d have preferred to use more lorem ipsum for this section, but out of fear of losing points, I’m going to try to follow instructions and try to ‘make it fun’ and ‘show my personality’ (though the last paragraph may be more lorem ipsum if I run of stuff to write).
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you can probably tell from the portfolio section, I’m kind-of a health nut and love eating fruits and vegetables.I also enjoy exercising and am sad to say that I’m losing lots of exercise time because of bootcamp, but I’ll catch up later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also like tech related stuff - computers, phones, gadgets. I’m also a big time gamer and would be happy to talk about video games with any who is also interested. I think that’s all I can think of writing for now. Thanks for your time!
